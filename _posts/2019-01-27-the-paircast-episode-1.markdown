Special thank you to our friends at [TWOSENSE.AI](https://www.twosense.ai) (Who are [hiring](https://www.twosense.ai/jobs/)!) for giving us a place to record.

In the first Paircast episode, Cameron and Scott begin rewriting Factory Bot.
The idea came from talking about a practice in classical art where students
recreate paintings by the great masters. We figured a great parallel in software
would be to take well tested and popular open source libraries written by
masters in our industry, and try to rewrite them using only the tests to guide
us.<br/><br/>

We chose [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) as our first
project since it fits all those criteria. From how familiar we both are with
Thoughtbot, we're confident that there will be comprehensive test coverage that
will enable us to eventually complete this series.<br/><br/>

To start out, we made sure our machine was set up correctly to run the tests,
and then deleted the `lib/` directory. Join us as we let the tests drive out a
new implementation.
