Special thank you to our friends at [TWOSENSE.AI](https://www.twosense.ai) (Who are [hiring](https://www.twosense.ai/jobs/)!) for giving us a place to record.
We've been putting this off for too long, and the space is perfect. Thank you!

This morning Cameron and I finished out first stream. We started out our first project of working on rebuilding
[FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) by deleting all the code and letting the tests fully drive out the implementation.
