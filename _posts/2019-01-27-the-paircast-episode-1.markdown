Special thank you to our friends at [TWOSENSE.AI](https://www.twosense.ai) (Who are [hiring](https://www.twosense.ai/jobs/)!) for giving us a place to record. We've been putting this off for too long, and the space is perfect.

<hr/>

This morning Cameron and I finished out first stream. We started out our first
project of working on rebuilding [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot) by deleting all the code and letting the tests fully drive out the implementation. By the end of our first hour we had fleshed out the
basic file structure, and got to the point where we have our first passing test.
